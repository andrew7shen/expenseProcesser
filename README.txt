Expense Processor

Motivation: I wanted to categorize and track my spending habits but there was no custom way that I could filter and compare transaction types.

Created Python tool to process PDF Bank of America Expense Statements and run analyses on spending habits.


Future Steps
1. Use JS React or Flask for front-end interface: can query different variables and make different categories
2. Scheduled tasks with Airflow every month when expense statements come in
3. Use some sort of ML model to make classifications of the payments
